<h1>Genomics Data Analysis Overview</h1>
<p>Genomics data analysis involves the use of computational tools and techniques to analyze large datasets generated by DNA sequencing technologies. These datasets can be used to study the genomic makeup of organisms, including their gene expression patterns, genetic variation, and evolutionary history.</p>

<h2>Gene Prediction</h2>
<p>Gene prediction is the process of identifying the location and structure of genes within a genome. This can be done using a variety of algorithms and techniques, including homology searches, spliced alignment, and machine learning approaches.</p>

<h2>Epigenetic status</h2>
<p>Epigenetic is the modifications on the nuclutides that can affect the gene switch on/off.</p>

<h2>Variant Analysis</h2>
<p>Variant analysis involves the identification and analysis of genetic variations within a genome, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (indels), and structural variations. These variations can be used to study the genetic basis of diseases and other traits, as well as to identify evolutionary relationships between different organisms.</p>

<h2>Evolutionary Analysis</h2>
<p>Evolutionary analysis involves the use of genomics data to study the evolutionary history of organisms and the forces that have shaped their genomes over time. This can include the identification of conserved and evolving regions within a genome, as well as the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships between different organisms.</p>
