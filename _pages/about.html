<h1 style="text-align:center"> Welcome to my personal site to see sharing on omics data! </h1>

<p>
This is Sen Guo.

<p>

I am currently working as a Scientific employee on omics data analysis and integration.
	
My main task is to set up analysis pipeline to analyze the omics data for immune disease, which will include expression, proteomics, epigenetics and other types of data. Collect a lot of papers on omics data analysis, while not finish reading them all.Daily play around with Linux, Perl, Python, R, HTML, snakemake...

</p>

<p>
I have several years experience in omics data analysis:
  <li><b>WGS/WES/WGBS </li>
  <li>RNA-seq/scRNA-seq/Transcription factors-network</li>
  <li>Transposable elements</li>
  <li>CHIP-seq</li>
  <li>ATAC-seq</li>
  <li>...</b></li>
</p>

<p>
Omics data analysis is more and more important in revealing the disease mechanism, to identify the most promising disease markers, construct the regulatory networks/modules, developing treatment drugs...
  

</p>
Good reviews:
